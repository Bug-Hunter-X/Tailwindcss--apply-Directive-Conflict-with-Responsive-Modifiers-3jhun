The solution is to avoid using `@apply` with responsive modifiers within components that already use responsive modifiers directly. One way to address this is to avoid using `@apply` with responsive modifiers within components that already use responsive modifiers directly. Instead, prefer explicitly writing out the styles.  For example, instead of using `@apply md:p-4`, you can directly use `md:p-4` within the component.

Another solution is to restructure your CSS to avoid the naming conflict:

```html
<div class="md:container">
  <button class="p-2 md:p-4">
    Click Me
  </button>
</div>
```

This ensures that the padding is applied correctly and avoids the conflict.  Also make sure your Tailwind configuration is correct and your styles are being processed in the expected order.  If you are using `@apply` excessively, consider rewriting some of your CSS in a more straightforward way for better maintainability and predictability.
